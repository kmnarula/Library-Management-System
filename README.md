# Library-Management-System

This was a project which I made several years ago when I was fairly new to the language C++. At the time, I was being taught C++ 96 and therefore, this 
project has been made using it. It contains some outdated concepts and is quite lengthy and doesn't follow the concept of separate compilation. However, 
it runs absolutely fine on C++ 96 platforms such as Turbo C++!
